# Key Binds

You can use your keyboard to control Kodi, this is the default setting but you can change what
the keyboard controls on the [settings page](#settings/web). The available options are:

## Kodi

The keyboard controls Kodi and default keyboard interaction with the browser is disabled.
(eg. using up and down arrows to scroll a page). [Browser command] = [Kodi action].

```
Cursor LEFT = Direction LEFT
Cursor RIGHT = Direction RIGHT
Cursor UP = Direction UP
Cursor DOWN = Direction DOWN
BACKSPACE = Back
ENTER = Select
TAB = Close
SPACE BAR = Play/Pause
Key "C" = Context menu
Key "+" = Volume Up
Key "-" = Volume Down
Key "X" = Stop
Key "T" = Toggle subtitles
Key ">" = Play Next
Key "<" = Play Prev
Key "\" = Full screen
```

## Browser

The keyboard controls the browser only. When the [remote](#remote) is open the keys will control only Kodi.

## Both

Keyboard commands are executed in Kodi and in the browser. When the [remote](#remote) is open the keys will
control only Kodi. NOTE: Many commands are shared by both the browser and Kodi. Eg. Backspace.
